# __Ross Goodliffe Portfolio__

This is my portfolio as a junior web developer

* It has been built from scratch using only 
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
 
I have used a JavaScript Script called smooth scroll to navigate through each section.
[Smooth Scroll](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll)

In order to have the form work and send the to my email address I have used 
[FormSpree](https://formspree.io/).
Formspree works by connecting my form to their endpoint and they email me the submission. It doesn't need any JavaScrip or PHP to work so is perfect for a static site like my portfolio.

I am currently looking for my first Junior Web Developer role around the Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire areas however I am also looking around the London area as I live near trainstations with very easy access into London.

This website has been built as a Desktop application and is responsive however has not been optimised for mobile browsing 
*this is functionality I will be looking to add soon with CSS media queries*
