# __Ross Goodliffe Portfolio__

This is my portfolio as a junior web developer

* It has been built from scratch using only 
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
 
I have used a JavaScript Libary called smooth scroll to navigate through each section.

In order to have the form work and send the to my email address I have used FormSpree.

This works by connecting my form to their endpoint and they email me the submission. It doesn't need any JavaScrip or PHP to work so is perfect for a static site like my portfolio.
